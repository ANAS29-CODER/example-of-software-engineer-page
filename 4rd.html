                 <h3 style="color: black;padding-bottom: 15px; ">I teach developers how to develop.</h3>

               
           <p>My name is Miles Sebesta. I was born 
             and raised in Visalia California where I attended Golden West High School.</p>
           <p>After Golden West I went on to graduate from UC Davis. </p>
           <p>Post college, I worked in Sacramento as a lead developer
             and online marketer before moving back to the Central Valley. </p>

             <p>I currently work for Geekwise Academy 
                 and Bitwise Industries as a developer instructor and business consultant.</p>
     <p>I am dedicated to bringing the latest and greatest website design to my hometown Visalia,
                                   California because I want to see technology change this great valley. </p>
                <p> am dedicated to teaching the next generation of developers and marketers
            so that the solutions are community needs are created at home by our neighbors.</p>

   <h3 >
    I titled this page “Web Design Visalia” because this really matters to me.</h3>

    <p>When I say “Website Design Visalia” I mean it! You get local code, made by local people.</p>
 <p>I won’t outsource your code to China or India. I believe it is important to keep business local and support the local San Joaquin Valley
      economy, and individuals that are looking to better our community, not take from it!</p>
<p>When you work with me you are
     getting a website design that was designed, and coded by a local developer.</p>

<p>You are also getting great customer support that 
    is paired with your “Website Design Visalia” service.</p> 

    <h3>Straight Forward Fact; Custom Costs</h3>
    <p>A custom web site costs twice as much as a template. </p>
    <p>For a custom brochure website expect to pay $6,000+</p>
    <p>For a custom eCommerce store look to pay $10,000+</p>
    <p>By custom design, I mean custom wireframes, mock-ups, and code / functionality.</p>
    <p>Meaning anyone ever mentions the word “template” then your prices should be HALF of 
        what I mentioned above! If you are paying “custom web design”
         prices for a template you are getting ripped off!</p>


         <h3>What web technologies do I use?</h3>
         <p>For basic eCommerce or simple websites you get an easy to maintain and update web 
             site through an online content management system like WordPress or Magento.
              Custom web applications depend completely on their performance tasks at hand thus 
             either LAMP, MEAN, or MEVN stacks will be used depending on project requirements.</p>

             <h3>Expect a quick turn around.</h3>
    
             <p>The date of completion depends upon the scope of work and time needed to complete a the
                  project. I like to create a great dialogue with you to provide a web site marketed and 
                  created directly towards your needs. Please, be weary of any designer that claims they 
                  can provide you with a custom website designed in a few weeks. I have been in the website
                   design industry for years and to be frank, it usually takes longer than that for a custom
                    site. The site is probably based upon a template rather than a “custom design”,
                     or corners might be cut. Those who claim such timely turn-a-rounds might have 
                     code that leaves your website vulnerable to spam and hackers.  Regardless, these
                      unrealistic dreams will leave a nasty taste in your mouth and hole in your pocket
                       book. I work
                  very direct, give you a fair estimate, and work to make the design perfect to your needs.</p>

                  <h3>Get great, local Visalia website support and customer support.</h3>
                  <p>I am always a phone call, you will not have to be put on hold while 
                      you are transferred to some foreign country.</p>

                      <h3>Finally, ask your developer to explain 301 redirects in an easy way!</h3>
                      <p>I believe you should work with people who have the heart of a teacher. Ask your developer about Title Tags, and 301 redirects,
                           if they can’t explain them in a way you understand then find a new developer!</p>
